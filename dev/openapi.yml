Returns *True* on success.\n\nExample: The [ImageBot](https://t.me/imagebot) needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of “Retrieving image, please wait…”, the bot may use [sendChatAction](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#sendchataction) with *action* = *upload\\_photo*. The user will see a “sending photo” status for the bot.\n\nWe only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a **noticeable** amount of time to arrive."
